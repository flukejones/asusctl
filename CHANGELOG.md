### Added
- Support for GV601V LED modes

## [v4.7.0]
### Added
- Support for FX507Z LED modes
- Support for GL503V LED modes
- Support for G733C LED modes
- Support for GV601VI LED modes
- Support for FX505G LED modes
- Support for GA402X LED modes
- Support for G634J LED modes (layout is in progress)
- Support the Rear Glow on some laptops
- Added field to aura_support to determine which LED power zones are supported. This will need folks to contribute data.
- Support M16 matrix display
  - Custom images
  - Pixel gifs
  - Power options
  - Builtin animations
- In-progress simulators for GA402, GU604 animatrix, optional build and takes a single arg
- Add `model_override` option to anime config, this is handy for forcing a model for "Unknown" anime, and for simulators
- Add `mini_led_mode` support to asusd and zbus crates (requires kernel patch https://lkml.org/lkml/2023/6/19/1264)
- Add `mini_led_mode` toggle to rog-control-center GUI, tray, notifications
- Add generation of typescript types from the rust types used via dbus using typeshare
- Add generation of introspection XML from asusd dbus
- Add a reworked gnome extension to the main repo under `desktop-extensions/gnome/`. This was done to better keep the extension in sync with work done on asusd, especially around breaking dbus
- Add support for the mid fan custom curves on some laptops
### Changed
- Move FX506HC to FX506H in arua DB to catch full series of this range
- Move FX506LH to FX506L in arua DB to catch full series of this range
- Move G513I* to G513I in arua DB to catch full series of this range
- Remove notification handle tracking limit, fixes KDE issue with profile notif
- Rename daemon and daemon-user crates to asusd and asusd-user to not be confusing in workspace naming
- Prevent the multiple notifications from a profile change from occuring (too many functions with side effects!)
- Apply keyboard brightness when setting a mode
- Update GL503 led config
- Arua LED power control has been heavily refactored for 0x19b6+ devices
- Rog Control Center:
  - Added option to enable/disable system tray
  - Added button to fully quit app (exits from background)
  - Moved application settings to new page
  - Aura LED power refactor is now taken advantage of in RCC, exposing all settings
### BREAKING
- All Anime related DBUS methods/notifs are changed
- All dbus interfaces that handled an enum have now been forced to use the enum as String type, not uint or similar, this unfortunately breaks a heap of stuff but has the benefit of allowing asusctl to use crates to generate a typescript (or other) binding to the types being used by zbus for the proxies. The implication here is that there will be an eventual tighter integration with the gnome extension and maybe KDE also.

## [v4.6.2]
- Fix rog-control-center not reopening if `startup_in_background` is set

- ROGCC: Don't notify user if changing to same mux mode
- ROGCC: Add CLI opt for loading a keyboard layout for testing, with live-reload on file change
- ROGCC: Add CLI opt for viewing all layout files + filenames to help find a layout matching your laptop
  + Both of these options would hopefully be temporary and replaced with a "wizard" GUI helper
- Fix profile controller not detecting if platform_profile is changed
- Fix remove the leftover initial config writes on `new()` for some controllers to prevent resetting settings on startup
  + refactor the loading of systemd curve defaults and config file
### BREAKING

- Changes to aura.conf:
- Changes to asusd-ledmodes.toml:

  + Raname `per_key` to `advanced` and change type from `bool` to `AdvancedAuraType`
  + Removed `prod_family`
  + Split all entries to `board_name` (separating `board_names`) (now a huge file)
  + removed `asusd-ledmodes.toml` in favour of `aura_support.ron` due to an unsupported type in toml
- Rename and adjust `LedSupportedFunctions` to closely match the above

## [v4.5.8]
### Changed
- Fix incorrect stop/start order of nvidia-powerd on AC plug/unplug

## [v4.5.7]
### Changed
- ROGCC: Don't notify user if changing to same mux mode
-

## [v4.5.7]
### Changed
- ROGCC: Don't notify user if changing to same mux mode
- asusd: don't block on systemd-unit change: removes all shoddy external command calls in favour of async dbus calls

## [v4.5.6]
### Changed
- Fix tasks not always running correctly on boot/sleep/wake/shutdown by finishing the move to async
- Change how the profile/fan change task monitors changes due to TUF laptops behaving slightly different
- ROGCC: Better handle the use of GPU MUX without supergfxd
- ROGCC: Track if reboot required when not using supergfxd
- Add env var for logging levels to daemon and gui (`RUST_LOG=<error|warn|info|debug|trace>`)
- ROGCC: Very basic support for running a command on AC/Battery switching, this is in config at `~/.config/rog/rog-control-center.cfg`, and for now must be edited by hand and ROGCC restarted (run ROGCC in BG to use effectively)
  + Run ROGCC from terminal to see errors of the AC/Battery command
  + Support for editing via ROGCC GUI will come in future
  + This is ideal for userspace tasks
- asusd: Very basic support for running a command on AC/Battery switching, this is in config at `/etc/asusd/asusd.conf`. A restart of asusd is not required if edited.
  + This is ideal for tasks that require root access (BE SAFE!)
- The above AC/Battery commands are probably best set to run a script for more complex tasks
- asusd: check if nvidia-powerd enabled before toggling

  - `NotifyMainsOnline`
- `nvidia-powerd.service` will now enable or disable depending on the AC power state

  problematic when on battery, not allowing the dgpu to suspend within decent time and
  sometimes blocking it completely.
- Notification to rog-control-center of dGPU state change

  basic with only a few effects done. Please see the manual for more information.

- Added three effects to use with Zoned or Per-Key:
  + Static, Breathe, Flicker. More to come.

  + There is no confirmation from the daemon, the program issuing the command
    must confirm the request.
  + systemd only
- Laptops with dedicated Nvidia mode:
  + You still must reboot for the bios to switch modes
  + On boot if dedicated mode is active then asusd will update the required configs
    to put display-manager in nvidia mode
